# 5.Write a program which contains filter(), map() and reduce() in it. Python application which
# contains one list of numbers. List contains the numbers which are accepted from user. Filter
# should filter out all prime numbers. Map function will multiply each number by 2. Reduce will
# return Maximum number from that numbers. (You can also use normal functions instead of
# lambda functions).
